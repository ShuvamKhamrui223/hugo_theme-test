      <description>A lot of interesting things are happening in my life, and living in different countries has brought me a wealth of new experiences. Over time, I’ve accumulated numerous photos and videos that I’d like to share.&#xA;Moreover, sometimes there isn’t enough opportunity to fully connect with family and friends, to share my emotions and impressions, and to answer their questions. That’s why I decided to create this blog.&#xA;Here, I’ll be sharing not only my travel impressions and emotions but also my observations and experiences of living in different countries.</description>
