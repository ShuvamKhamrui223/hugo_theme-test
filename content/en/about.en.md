A lot of interesting things are happening in my life, and living in different countries has brought me a wealth of new experiences. Over time, I’ve accumulated numerous photos and videos that I’d like to share.

Moreover, sometimes there isn’t enough opportunity to fully connect with family and friends, to share my emotions and impressions, and to answer their questions. That’s why I decided to create this blog.

Here, I’ll be sharing not only my travel impressions and emotions but also my observations and experiences of living in different countries.

I hope you find something interesting and inspiring here.
